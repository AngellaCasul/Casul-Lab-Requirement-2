# To run the program on the browser, you need to follow these steps:
First, open the terminal on VS Code and type the command "flask run" or "set FLASK_APP=app.py" then "flask run".
After that, it will show you a localhost address.
Copy the address and paste it on your browser's web address search bar.
After that, it will show you my website named "GradeGlide".
You can now enter your Prelim grade or any number to check different results.
If you want the program to stop running, just simply go back to VS Code's terminal and type CTRL + C to end the program then close the tab on your browser.
